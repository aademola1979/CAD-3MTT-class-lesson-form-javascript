## Javascript lesson

### Welcome

During the lesson of 24th February, each learner created an HTML form.
See the link to the repository of that lesson [here](https://github.com/aademola1979/form-practice){:target="_blank"}
. During the lesson of 2nd March 2024, we created and linked to the form a javascript file. The javascript codes were provided and explained by the instructor. I added some more comments to make it comprehensible to fellow beginners.

- **Who is this for:** A javascript beginner
- **What you will learn:** You will learn to collect data through HTML form, validate the data and manipulate it, using javascript.
- **What you'll build**: a web app that can:
  1. receive inputs from users,
  2. validate the inputs,
  3. and send it as an alert to the browser.

See the demo [here](https://aademola1979.github.io/CAD-3MTT-class-lesson-form-javascript/){:target="_blank"}
.

- **Prerequisites:** A basic knowledge of HTML and javascript will aid comprehension.

The javascript codes belong to my instructor at CAD.
